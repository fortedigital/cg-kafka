# Extra Task - Streaming Data from Wikimedia to Kafka and OpenSearch

## Overview:
This document outlines an extra task aimed at integrating streaming data from the Wikimedia RecentChanges stream (`stream.wikimedia.org/v2/stream/recentchange`) into Apache Kafka and then consuming this data to index it into OpenSearch for search and analysis purposes.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this task is to demonstrate the end-to-end flow of streaming data from an external source (Wikimedia RecentChanges) to Kafka, and subsequently indexing this data into OpenSearch for search and analysis purposes.

## Steps:

1. **Setting up Kafka:**
    - Ensure that Apache Kafka is installed and running on your local machine or a server.
    - Create a Kafka topic to store the incoming messages from the Wikimedia stream.

2. **Producing Messages to Kafka:**
    - Develop a Kafka producer application in your preferred programming language (e.g., Java, Python) to consume messages from the Wikimedia RecentChanges stream.
    - Use HTTP client libraries (e.g., Apache HttpComponents, Python Requests) to connect to the stream endpoint (`stream.wikimedia.org/v2/stream/recentchange`) and consume the JSON messages.
    - Serialize the messages and produce them to the Kafka topic created in step 1.

3. **Consuming Messages from Kafka:**
    - Develop a Kafka consumer application to read messages from the Kafka topic.
    - Implement logic to process these messages and prepare them for indexing into OpenSearch.
      - Use category information from the messages to determine the appropriate OpenSearch index to store the data.
    - You may choose to use a Kafka consumer library in your preferred programming language (e.g., Java, Python) to simplify the process of consuming messages from Kafka.

4. **Indexing Data into OpenSearch:**
    - Utilize the OpenSearch client SDK or REST APIs to index the processed data from Kafka into OpenSearch.
    - Define an appropriate index mapping in OpenSearch to store the Wikimedia RecentChanges data.

5. **Testing and Validation:**
    - Test the end-to-end flow by running the Kafka producer to consume messages from the Wikimedia stream and produce them to Kafka.
    - Verify that messages are successfully indexed into OpenSearch and are searchable.

## Additional Considerations:

- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms in both the Kafka producer and consumer to handle exceptions gracefully and ensure fault tolerance.
- **Scaling:** Consider scalability aspects, such as partitioning Kafka topics and distributing the workload across multiple consumers, to handle large volumes of data.
- **Data Transformation:** Depending on the structure of the incoming data from Wikimedia, you may need to perform transformations or enrichments before indexing it into OpenSearch.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up monitoring and logging to track the performance and health of the Kafka cluster, as well as the indexing process into OpenSearch.
